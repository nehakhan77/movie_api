    <h1>Movie API</h1>
    <p>Objective: To build a server-side component of a "movies" web application. The web application will provide users
        to access information about a variety of movies, directors, and genres they have watched or are interested in.
        Users will be able to sign up, update their personal information, and create a list of their favorite movies!
